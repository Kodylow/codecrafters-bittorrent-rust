# Bencode

Serialization format for the BitTorrent protocol. Bencode supports four data types:

- strings
  - Strings are encoded as `<length>:<contents>`. For example, the string "hello" is encoded as "5:hello".
  - Printing a string requires inner quotes.
- integers
  - Integers are encoded as `i<integer>e`. For example, the integer 123 is encoded as `i123e`.
  - Negative integers are supported as `i-123e`.
- lists
  - Lists are encoded as `l<bencoded_elements>e`.
  - For example, `["hello", 52]` would be encoded as `l5:helloi52ee`. Note that there are no separators between the elements.
- dictionaries
  - A dictionary is encoded as `d<key1><value1>...<keyN><valueN>e`. `<key1>`, `<value1>` etc. correspond to the bencoded keys & values. The keys are sorted in lexicographical order and must be strings.
  - For example, `{"hello": 52, "foo":"bar"}` would be encoded as: `d3:foo3:bar5:helloi52ee` (note that the keys were reordered).

# Torrent metainfo

A torrent file (also known as a metainfo file) contains a bencoded dictionary with the following keys and values:

- `announce`: URL to a "tracker", which is a central server that keeps track of peers participating in the sharing of a torrent.
- `info`:
  A dictionary with keys:
  length: size of the file in bytes, for single-file torrents
  - `name`: suggested name to save the file / directory as
  - `piece length`: number of bytes in each piece
  - `pieces`: concatenated SHA-1 hashes of each piece
  - Note: .torrent files contain bytes that arenâ€™t valid UTF-8 characters. You'll run into problems if you try to read the contents of this file as a String. Use &[u8] or Vec<u8> instead.

Note: The info dictionary looks slightly different for multi-file torrents. For this challenge, we'll only implement support for single-file torrents.

## Info hash

Info hash is a unique identifier for a torrent file. It's used when talking to trackers or peers.

- To calculate the info hash:
  - Extract the info dictionary from the torrent file after parsing
  - Bencode the contents of the info dictionary
  - Calculate the SHA-1 hash of this bencoded dictionary

# Discover Peers

Trackers are central servers that maintain information about peers participating in the sharing and downloading of a torrent. To discover peers, make a request to the tracker URL extracted as `announce` from the torrent file.

- info_hash: the info hash of the torrent
  - 20 bytes long, will need to be URL encoded
  - Note: this is NOT the hexadecimal representation, which is 40 bytes long
- peer_id: a unique identifier for your client
  - A string of length 20 that you get to pick.
- port: the port your client is listening on
  - You can set this to 6881, you will not have to support this functionality during this challenge.
- uploaded: the total amount uploaded so far
  - Since your client hasn't uploaded anything yet, you can set this to 0.
- downloaded: the total amount downloaded so far
  - Since your client hasn't downloaded anything yet, you can set this to 0.
- left: the number of bytes left to download
  - Since you client hasn't downloaded anything yet, this'll be the total length of the file (you've extracted this value from the torrent file in previous stages)
- compact: whether the peer list should use the compact representation
  - For the purposes of this challenge, set this to 1.
  - The compact representation is more commonly used in the wild, the non-compact representation is mostly supported for backward-compatibility.
